Yunus identifies as a Muslim and has expressed the importance that salah and Ishq-e-Muhammadi holds to him in his personal life.[24] His father, Haji Muhammad Dula Mia Saudagar, completed Hajj three times and was a disciple of two prominent Sufis of Chittagong. Yunus continues to actively display a normative orthodox Sunnite theological creed, whilst rejecting superstition.[145] He encourages the public to engage in Dua directly to Allah,[146][147] whom Yunus publicly recognises as the supreme source of assistance and support,[148] and as the master of Divine Decree.[149] Yunus has also referred to the Qur'an as the "guide for mankind" and acknowledged the concept of ummah in his public speeches.[145]

In 1967, while Yunus attended Vanderbilt University, he met Vera Forostenko, a student of Russian literature at Vanderbilt University and daughter of Russian immigrants to Trenton, New Jersey, United States. They were married in 1970.[18][24] Yunus's marriage with Vera ended within months of the birth of their baby girl, Monica Yunus, in 1979 in Chittagong,[150] as Vera returned to New Jersey claiming that Bangladesh was not a good place to raise a baby.[18][24] Monica Yunus became an operatic soprano based in New York City.[151] Yunus later married Afrozi Yunus, who was then a researcher in physics at Manchester University.[24] She was later appointed as a professor of physics at Jahangirnagar University. Their daughter Deena Afroz Yunus was born in 1986.[24]

Yunus's brother Muhammad Ibrahim is a former professor of physics at the University of Dhaka and the founder of The Center for Mass Education in Science (CMES), which brings science education to adolescent girls in villages.[152] His other brother Muhammad Jahangir (d. 2019) was a television presenter and a social activist in Bangladesh.[153]
